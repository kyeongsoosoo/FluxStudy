In order to get started check out the [overview and guides](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples) maintained on GitHub, or continue on to the in-depth overview, which explores in more detail how the pieces of the Flux architecture work together.

> Note: The in-depth overview was formerly the normal overview landing page but was replaced with the more terse and up-to-date guides on GitHub that are linked above.
